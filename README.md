Open the code onto google colab 
Load the data from the datasets file into the code onto colab and change runtime to T4 CPU on colab. 
Change the data loader according to the datasets you want to run zero with zero, one with one, and two with two. There should be three datasets. 
Example:
train_df = pd.read_csv('train0.csv') # Load training and test files
test_df = pd.read_csv('test0.csv')   # Load training and test files
Then run the code and the results should be output.

Step 1: Open the code onto google colab 


Step 2: Load the data from the datasets file into the code onto colab and change runtime to T4 CPU on colab. 


Step 3: Change the data loader according to the datasets you want to run zero with zero, one with one, and two with two. There should be three datasets. 

Example:
train_df = pd.read_csv('train0.csv') # Load training and test files

test_df = pd.read_csv('test0.csv')   # Load training and test files


Step 4: Then run the code and the results should be output.
